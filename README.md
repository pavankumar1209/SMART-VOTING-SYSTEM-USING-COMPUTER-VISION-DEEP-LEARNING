# SMART-VOTING-SYSTEM-USING-COMPUTER-VISION-DEEP-LEARNING

Abstract:
  An online voting system for Organization election . The proposed model has a greater security in the sense that voter high security password is confirmed before the vote is accepted in the main database of an organization. The additional feature of the model is that the voter can confirm if his/her vote has gone to correct candidate/party. In this model a person can also vote from outside of his/her allotted constituency or from his/her preferred location. In the proposed system the tallying of the votes will be done automatically, thus saving a huge time and enabling Organization to announce the result within a very short period.
existing:
  In existing systems, voters go to the voting centers and they use their votes manually. It is time consuming and there is chance of gambling the votes. These system relies on huge number of skilled people to work at polling booths and hence is difficult to scale up.
proposed:
  In the proposed system, we have tried to build a secure online voting system that is free from unauthorized access while casting votes by the voters. The server aspects of the proposed system have such distribution of authority that server does not enable to manipulate the votes.for database we can apply hashing technique for data hiding.surrounding person counting if more than one person detect then our model close if one person detected then we go for the face recognition
